      <h1>Living in Russia vs USA: Pros and Cons</h1>
      <p>I've had the pleasure of experiencing everyday life on two very different continents, and I believe it's time to reflect.</p>
      <p>
       Having spent over 13 years living in various US states and around 15 years in Russia, I've engaged in hundreds of conversations with people from all walks of life about the quality of life in these places. My diverse upbringing includes working different jobs and receiving education in both Russia and the US. I aim to provide a fair and balanced critique, as I don't consider myself biased toward either country. However, I recognize that there are many people with different experiences and opinions, which is perfectly normal. Here, I will discuss strictly my personal experiences. These observations are filtered through my own worldview and cannot be entirely objective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I have some political opinions, this discussion won't delve deeply into the political choices of either country. Instead, it will focus on factors that shape the life of an average working-class person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each point I mention could easily be expanded into a separate article, but due to limited time, I'll leave them open to interpretation. I also won't mention pros and cons that are similar in both countries. Here are the pros and cons in a nutshell:
